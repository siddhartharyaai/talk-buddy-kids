It was a little bird who had fallen from its nest high up in a tree. All the other animals were too big to help, but Ellie had an idea! She used her long trunk to gently lift the little bird back to its nest. The bird was so happy and chirped a beautiful thank you song. From that day on, Ellie learned that being small didn't matter - what mattered was being kind and helpful. All the forest animals became Ellie's best friends, and she was known as the bravest little elephant in the whole forest! üåü",
